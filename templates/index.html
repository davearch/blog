    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is David and this is my blog. I'm a software engineer and I love to code and read and ride my bike.</p>
    <p>This blog is written in a combination of common lisp using the caveman2 web framework and vanilla JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Now you might ask: "But David, why not use ReactJS/NextJS/SvelteKit/{insert the latest front end craze}???"</p>
    <p>Well, that's just simply too basic for my taste. That's like asking me why I don't just go to Starbucks everyday instead of the local fair trade coffeeshop.</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong - I totally go to Starbucks every now and then. But it's not the style that I want to present to the world.</p>
    <p>As far as lisp is concerned, I just luv it and think it's cool. That's pretty much it. Also I don't really know it too well so I thought this would be a great project for learning.</p>
    <br />
    <p>These are my latest blog posts</p>
    <ul>
      {% for post in posts %}
      <li>
	<a href="/blog/{{ post.id }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
